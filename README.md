# GuessTheWord
A JavaScript Wordle clone for my students.

I had originally started this project as a way to practice Python development, [Python Wordle Clone](https://github.com/5unagawa/Python-Wordle-Clone).

Unfortunately, the schools I work at use Chromebooks which means I can't simply distribute an executable script for students to run on their personal devices.

I decided that instead of trying to convince each school to let me install Python on every single computer for a potentially one-time thing, it would be easier to make it into a web application.

I guess on the plus side, I'm practicing JavaScript more?
