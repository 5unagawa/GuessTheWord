# GuessTheWord
A JavaScript Wordle clone for my students.

I had originally started this project as a way to practice Python development. [link to other project]
Unfortunately, the schools I work at use Chromebooks which means I can't simply distribute an executable script.
I decided that instead of trying to convince staff to let me install Python on every single computer for a one-time thing, it would be easier to make it into a web app.

I guess on the plus side, I'm practicing JavaScript more?
